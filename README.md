# Classic Games

A collection of classic video games implemented in Python using [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org) and [PyGame Zero](https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io).
These games are built in collaboration with my children to teach them programming and video game dynamics.

## Games (so far)

- Tennis: a Pong clone in which two players use paddles to bat a ball back and forth
- Bunny: a top-down platform game
- Cavern: a fix platform game
- Centipod: a scrolling platform game
- Soccer: a Sensidle Soccer clone
